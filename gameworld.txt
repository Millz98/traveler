2. Mechanics of Time Travel & The Director

Consciousness Transfer
The show’s time travel technology doesn’t involve physical movement across time—it’s about information. Travelers’ minds are uploaded into present-day hosts at the brink of death.

Temporal Restrictions
A new traveler can only be sent to a time no earlier than the most recent traveler—this avoids catastrophic “ripples” in the timeline. 
travelers.fandom.com

Alternate Timelines
Time travel creates altered futures. The Director, existing outside time, manages or discards these timelines as needed.

Suggestions for Your Game’s Accuracy

Mind-Only Time Travel: Emphasize the limits—travelers can’t bring gear, only instructions and their skill sets.

Strict Protocol Enforcement: Build tension around the rules and the temptation to break them.

Ethics at the Core: Frame missions so players must make hard choices—what’s worth sacrificing?

Opposition Forces: Consider including The Faction as ideological antagonists, not just time crisis threats.

Visual & Environmental Flavor: Incorporate the bunker aesthetic, utilitarian clothing, and nanite technology in gameplay and visuals.

Timeline Fragility: Maybe include dynamic timelines that shift based on player actions, handled “off-screen” by an AI Narrator.

The Director

Quantum AI Overseer
The Director is a post-apocalyptic-era quantum artificial intelligence created to oversee the Grand Plan—sending human consciousnesses back in time to prevent civilization’s collapse. It exists “outside of time” and can monitor and manipulate timelines.

Game-Building Considerations

The Director

Design an AI overseeing missions—with branching timelines and consequences based on player choices.

Include missions where ethics demand the breaking of Protocols (e.g., saving innocents) and face tribunal consequences.

Travelers

Emphasize undercover life: skill-based missions, limited resources, building trust while keeping identities hidden.

Incorporate a tribunal mechanic—players risk execution (overwrite) if they deviate too much.

Traveler 001

A recurring antagonist whose motivations are mysterious—tease out his fragmented goals and hidden network.

Include flashbacks or DLC arcs showing his rise from defected test subject to Faction leader.

The Faction

Provide moral grayness: shock tactics vs survival ethics.

Missions could involve attempts to intercept or mimic Faction operations, sabotaging their objectives or questioning shared values.

The Travelers are sent to the present day (around our current era) because their future—roughly 400 years ahead—is a dystopian wasteland on the brink of extinction. The core reason they’re sent back is to alter a series of historical events that, in the original timeline, led to the collapse of human civilization.

Here’s the breakdown of what they’re trying to change and why:

The Future They Come From

The world of the Travelers (circa 2449) is devastated by:

Climate change and rising global temperatures.

Nuclear contamination and failed energy projects.

Widespread famine and resource depletion.

Plagues and pandemics (some man-made, some natural).

Societal collapse, forcing humanity underground into shelters powered by dwindling nuclear energy.

Survivors live in controlled environments (glass-domed shelters) with limited food (yeast-based), recycled water, and failing infrastructure.

The Grand Plan

Created by the Director (the quantum AI), the Grand Plan is a long-term, step-by-step strategy to correct key moments in the past.

Rather than one big event, it’s about course-correcting a series of critical junctures to create a sustainable future.

Each mission is a piece of a larger puzzle—sometimes small (preventing a death of a key scientist) and sometimes massive (stopping nuclear disasters).

Key Events & Missions Travelers Targeted

While the series shows many operations, the main areas of focus include:

Helios 685 Asteroid Impact (Season 1)

A major mission was to deflect or destroy an asteroid set to cause catastrophic damage in 2018.

This mission largely defines the early timeline and exposes the Travelers to the public eye.

Nuclear Meltdown Prevention

Preventing reactor meltdowns or project failures that poisoned the future.

One mission involved stopping the creation of a singularity engine—a disastrous energy experiment.

Disease Prevention

Introducing cures or vaccines for plagues that otherwise decimate populations.

Technological & Political Manipulation

Ensuring the survival (or elimination) of key individuals—scientists, politicians, engineers—whose choices either save or doom the future.

Limiting Faction Influence

Fighting against the Faction (a human-led opposition to the Director) who aim to change history in ways that benefit them in the short term but devastate the long-term timeline.

Why Not Go Further Back?

The time travel tech has a temporal limit: they can only send consciousnesses as far back as the last sent traveler.

So they must work from “now” backward—this is why the present day becomes the main operational field.

Moral Core of Their Mission

The show constantly questions: How much should you change to save the future?

Their mission often sacrifices individuals, relationships, and even innocent lives to achieve “the greater good.”

Protocols (like not reproducing, not altering history unnecessarily, and prioritizing missions over personal attachments) are meant to minimize damage.

Endgame

By the end of Season 3, the Grand Plan partially fails—many missions are compromised, and the timeline fractures.

A new timeline (Protocol Omega) is initiated, where the Director sends a fresh wave of Travelers to attempt a cleaner reset, potentially rewriting the entire mission history.


In the Travelers TV show, hacking plays a significant role, primarily in the context of the show's time travel premise. The show's central concept involves individuals from the future traveling back in time and inhabiting the bodies of people in the present day. The show explores how these "travelers" use technology, including hacking, to achieve their missions and navigate their new realities. 
Here's how hacking is portrayed in the series:
Accessing Information:
Hacking is used to access information and data relevant to their missions, including historical records, communication networks, and personal information of individuals they need to interact with. 
Disrupting Systems:
The travelers also use hacking to disrupt systems, interfere with events, and manipulate situations to align with their objectives of saving humanity. 
Discovering the Past:
In the first season, Grant, an FBI agent, discovers a dark web chat room with mysterious codes. This leads him to realize he is destined to be a traveler and that his death will be altered, though its circumstances will remain. 
Real-World Implications:
The show also uses hacking to examine the real-world implications of cyber risk, staging live hacks to explore potential vulnerabilities and consequences according to Risk Management Monitor. 
Unexpected Twists:
The show often features unexpected twists and turns, including hacking-related events that challenge the travelers and force them to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. 

Grand Plan
Sign in to edit
The Director, a Quantum AI, has calculated a series of actions both large and small that will mitigate the destruction of the earth and the near extinction of humankind. This is known as the Grand Plan, also referred to as the Master Plan or The Director's Plan.

Some of these actions are quite large, such as preventing the asteroid Helios-685 from striking Earth and cause a chain reaction leading to an ice age. Some are not as large, such as protecting a person who will play a pivotal role in the future. Some missions require an entire team, and some only one or two people, and there is the rare mission that requires teams to work together. On some combo missions, each team's ultimate mission goal is not the same, but they have to work in concert for the overall success. (S1E06: Helios-685, S2E10: 21C)

No mission is unimportant, as each is a key element in the Grand Plan that affects the ultimate outcome.

Revisions
The Grand Plan has undergone innumerable changes since its inception. The simple goal - a path to a better future for humanity - has not changed, but many variables in the plan require the Director to make adjustments, including:

Misfires. Not every Traveler consciousness arrives successfully in its intended host body. These deaths require missions to be reassigned or redesigned.
Human error. The Traveler teams ordered to carry out their missions do not always do so successfully, or within their stated parameters. Travelers might die or fail at their missions, save people who were not intended to be saved (such as the boy Aleksander), or kill people who were not fated to die. These human errors can change the future in ways not intended by the Grand Plan, necessitating alterations.
Sedition. Some Travelers may outright betray the Director, choosing to abandon their missions and live out their life in the 21st (S1E04: Hall), or actively work against the Grand Plan. The Director likely did not account for the existence of the Faction when designing its plan.
Unintended consequences. In the absence of an alternate historical record, the Director is not able to immediately see how its actions will change the future. For example, the Grand Plan required the Travelers to deflect the asteroid Helios-685, which saved over 90 million lives. However, this resulted in the survival of Samantha Burns and Amanda Myers - two scientists who invented the singularity engine, which killed over 1.4 billion people instead. (S3E08: Archive)
Discovery. There was no way to predict that Vincent Ingram/Dr. Perrow would reveal the existence of the Traveler program. Nonetheless, the Director referred to its own discovery as "inevitable" at a certain juncture of the plan. It used the supercomputer Ilsa as a messenger in order to communicate with 21st-century law enforcement. (S3E01: Ilsa)
Contingency Plans
The Director has at least one backup plan available in the event of an existential threat to the Grand Plan. The first, called Plan X, may or may not have been designed by the Director itself (it is not specified whether the order was given prior to the Director's corruption by the Faction): Ellis was ordered to build a quantum frame capable of storing the Director's consciousness. If the Director were threatened in the future, it would send itself back in time using the frame as a host. (S1E12: Grace)

Another contingency plan has the Director secretly uploading a time travel program into the Ilsa supercomputer. Combined with a consciousness transfer machine, this allows Travelers in the 21st century to send one of their own further back in time. This plan is enacted following impending nuclear armageddon unleashed by Traveler 001. Grant MacLaren is sent to a younger version of himself in August 2001 to prevent Traveler 001 from ever being sent back in time. The mission is a success, ending Version One of the Traveler program and starting Version Two in its place. (S3E10: Protocol Omega)





Travelers are people from the future inhabiting host bodies in the past. Utilizing consciousness transfer and time travel technologies, these people overwrite the hosts' original personalities, then use the bodies to undertake missions in the 21st century. These missions are done in service to the Grand Plan under guidance from an entity known as the Director in order to rectify the mistakes of the past and ultimately undo the post-apocalyptic future they originated from.

Travelers are usually assigned in teams, usually in groups of five, each contributing their own specialties for the benefit of their assigned missions. While their goal is to ensure a better future, they must still adhere to a set of Protocols to minimize unintended consequences of meddling with the past.

Host
The Director selects hosts for Traveler missions depending on certain factors.

Firstly, there must be a historical record of the host that survives into the future. The bare minimum is a T.E.L.L. of the host's historical death. Cellphones and other location-tracking technologies have only become ubiquitous by the early 21st century that T.E.L.L.s for a wide selection of candidates are available; earlier eras in time are difficult to transfer to, if not impossible. (S1E01: Travelers, S3E10: Protocol Omega)

Secondly, the host body must be healthy. Missions can be physically demanding. However, the Director can make mistakes based on incomplete or misleading historical records: Marcy Warton was allegedly a librarian, but Traveler 3569 transferred into a host with severe mental disabilities as her social media profile was a complete fabrication. Philip Pearson was listed by his family as a first-time heroin user, not an ongoing addict. (S1E01: Travelers) Health stipulations can be disregarded on purpose if the mission is more paramount: Traveler 0117 transferred into Bloom, a terminally ill woman, and her only purpose is to oversee the installation of the x-ray laser that should prevent the asteroid Helios-685 from striking Earth. Likewise, The Church of Our Rapture are all composed of elderly men and women who have been tasked with providing security for Bloom's mission. (S1E06: Helios-685)

Thirdly, the host body must be about to die of a preventable cause. The Director is prohibited from ending a life too soon. Marcy was beaten to death by some hooligans in the historical record, but Traveler 3569 transfers to her moments before that happens and beats her assailants instead. Carly Shannon was also beaten to death by her domestic partner Jeff Conniker, but Traveler 3465 changes her fate and beats Jeff instead. Gower was considered a host candidate, but he has an unavoidable heart attack before he can be used for any missions and thus rejected. (S1E01: Travelers)

Hosts can be reused depending on the situation. Traveler 3569 transfers into Marcy twice, the second time to avoid the damaged parts of her brain, although at the cost of forgetting her 21st century memories as from her point of view she just arrived from the future the first time. (S1E11: Marcy) Aaron Donner became host to Travelers 4022 and 4024, with 4022 overwritten by the latter because of his betrayal of the Grand Plan. (S1E08: Donner)

Training
Before transferring to the 21st century, Travelers undergo extensive training, both in general skills and in their fields of expertise. Medics, for example, are experts in 21st century medicine. Historians memorize information perfectly. As operatives in the field they often have martial training, both in unarmed and armed combat. (S1E01: Travelers)

Future society is radically different from 21st century norms. Travelers must also relearn the social aspects of living in the time period through formal training programs. The subtler points are sometimes overlooked because of the gulf of centuries; Trevor Holden has difficulty parsing text lingo while Marcy has no problems answering her door naked before David Mailer tells her it's inappropriate. (S1E01: Travelers, S2E07: 17 Minutes)

Because they sometimes have to transfer to hosts with chaotic final moments, their training may also include how to surmount their hosts' demise. Aaron Donner practiced countless times to defuse a bomb his host brought, but he failed at the actual scenario: Donner was among the original casualties, but Traveler 4022 ran away and left his teammates to die instead. Ellis historically died by getting tangled up in farm machinery, but Traveler 0014 had the presence of mind to cut through the wiring. (S1E08: Donner, S1E11: Marcy)

Transfers
Main article: Consciousness transfer
Travelers can only transfer into the body of a host who is destined to die soon. The justification is that the host is already dying but the transfer of consciousness will save the host's body, though kill their consciousness. It will also result in the loss of all memories from the host's previous consciousness, which is why research into the host's life before the Traveler is important: to find out who was in their life and what they did as much as possible. (S1E01: Travelers)

Transfers are sequential and can only happen after the previous one. Messengers or Travelers cannot be sent further back than the most recent one due to ripples in the timeline.

eams and Roles
Traveler teams are typically made up of five members. If they lose members, someone may have to step up and take on multiple roles, unless the Director deems it necessary to send replacements. (S1E05: Room 101, S2E09: Update) Some Travelers have specialized missions and operate alone or with a more focused team composition.

Team Leader
Main article: Team Leader
Team leaders are in charge of their teams and hence responsible for their actions. They lead missions and are normally the ones who receive messages from the Director about their next mission. Team leaders have to make the tough calls on behalf of their team.

Tactician
Main article: Tactician
Tacticians are in charge of the security of their team and hence are highly trained with weapons and in combat. They often patrol buildings when their teams are investigating in order to protect them from attackers and set up defences around the perimeter of the building if something or someone needs protecting.

Medic
Main article: Medic
Medics are trained in an assortment of 21st century medicine. They are responsible for healthcare needs of those on their team, including giving vaccinations prior to epidemics, performing surgery, and checking up on the general health of their team members.

The only time a Medic isn't in charge of their team's healthcare is if the Director has decided that Doctors need to step in.

Historian
Main article: Historian
Historians are the information specialists. With their perfect recall, they can supply financing to the team with memorized gambling outcomes, lotto numbers, stock investments, and the like. They keep track of potential host candidate T.E.L.L.s so the incoming Traveler can integrate more smoothly with their assigned team.

As the future is always changing the information Historians memorized sometimes become out of date. They are then invited to Update sessions with fellow Historians for the self-explanatory updates to their knowledge stores. However, they are forbidden to speak of these updates to anyone else via Protocol 2H.

Engineer
Main article: Engineer
Engineers create the team's futuristic gadgets using 21st century supplies, and also do quality control on components passed along from team to team. One of their first tasks would be building subdermal comms for the team so they can communicate with each other at all times.

Specialist Roles
Main article: Specialist
These Traveler roles are outside the defined composition of the standard team, but they are vital (if more so) to the functioning of the Traveler program.

Programmer
The Programmers are responsible for creating and maintaining the Director as well as the attendant systems and rules governing the entire Traveler program. Due to their highly important role, they have very low Traveler numbers.

Doctor
Doctors undertake missions of a purely medical nature, and thus comprise their own D-Team. The Director sends them to people whose survival is deemed important to the Grand Plan.

Archivist
Main article: Archivist
An Archivist's job is to ensure the Director has a comprehensive store of historical information. They are infused with nanites that they regularly store in heavily guarded Archive blood banks around the world. They help Historians understand the changes to the timeline by organizing their periodic Updates.

Solo
Some Travelers don't have a specific team role and are sent to the 21st century for a single mission or purpose, outside of the roles listed above.

Nonstandard Teams
Some Travelers are organized into units that do not fit the typical five-person standard. The Director could have specific tasks for them that require they operate as a team. One group is dedicated to refining uranium for the Director's future use. Archives have dedicated support teams providing security and transport to the vital historical information in them. The Church of Our Rapture is a group of old evangelicals used as extra security during the Helios-685 mission. (S2E06: U235, S1E06: Helios-685, S3E08: Archive)

Some teams arise as an impromptu grouping. The Faction possessed an FBI task force headed by Wakefield in their bid to take over operations in the past after crippling the Director. When the Director turned back online, it overwrote all the Faction members it could find, the FBI members included. This FBI Team is now a group of Travelers ready to respond to manpower needs in addition to their regular FBI duties. Wakefield, in addition to heading this team, appears to be a member of another team, mentioning a separate teammate in the NSA. (S2E01: Ave Machina, S2E06: U235, S3E01: Ilsa)

Self-Regulation
Travelers are expected to follow local laws and customs like any other person unless superseded by orders or missions from the Director. Because there are always a lot of variables to consider in any given scenario, the Director allows for accomplishing missions that may deviate from specified instructions, and may let off erring teams with a warning. However, doing things that are seen as a threat to the Grand Plan is something that the Director and the Travelers take very seriously.

To that end, a Traveler accused of jeopardizing the Grand Plan is tried in a tribunal composed of their peers and streamed via the deep web backchannel for remote viewers. The accused is given the chance to defend their actions, and witnesses may be called to corroborate or refute their words. Depending on the severity of the "crime", other Travelers cast their vote if the accused is guilty or not, or the Director makes the final decision. There is only one punishment if the accused is found guilty: death by immediate overwrite. Thanks to surveillance recording everything for future posterity, the accused has an exact T.E.L.L. that can be used to transfer another Traveler consciousness into the body. (S1E08: Donner, S2E08: Traveler 0027)

The Faction
Main article: The Faction
All Travelers were once unified in the goal of saving humanity under the Director's guidance. However, enough changes to the timeline occurred that Shelter 41, which originally collapsed and killed its occupants, now thrived and became a hotbed of people who rejected the Grand Plan. These people coalesced into the Faction, and instigated a rebellion against the Director in the future and attempted to take over Traveler operations believing that decisions about humanity's future should be entrusted to its own hands and not a machine. (S1E11: Marcy)

Travelers in the 21st century who came from a future without the Faction can become disillusioned enough to join their ranks. (S3E06: Philip)


The Director is an entity in the future that oversees Travelers in the past, in charge of handing them missions, selecting host candidates, calculating their T.E.L.L.s for consciousness transfer, and a myriad of other operations.
The Director can only communicate through Messengers and computer networks. It is eventually revealed that it is a highly advanced quantum AI program that created the Grand Plan . (S1E12: Grace) The Director defines itself as "a sentient multi-zettaflop quantum frame." (S3E01: Ilsa)


The Director was always referred to by name - no one used the "it" pronoun until Grace Day reveals that she rebooted the Director. (S1E12: Grace) Travelers often speak of the Director as if it were a person making decisions ("I have faith in the Director's plan," or "The Director won't like that.")

The Director is a superintelligent entity that controls not only the time travel program, but every aspect of living by the remnants of humanity in the future. Use of the program to allocate resources and protect the shelters has kept humanity alive. However, members of the anti-Director faction object to an AI making decisions they'd rather make themselves and intend to destroy it. (S1E11: Marcy)

Grace, Simon (004), and Ellis are the only programmers who are specified as creators of the Director. Other programmers may have assisted in its creation, while some may have become programmers after the fact.

History
Origin
A man named Robert Fraser discovered a new element in 2068. This element proved vital to the creation of room-temperature superconductors - equipment used to create the Director. Subsequent leaps in quantum computing eventually lead to the creation of artificial superintelligence. (S2E07: 17 Minutes)

The Director was built in a mountain range along the United State-Canada border at an unspecified point in the future. (S2E06: U235)

Traveler Program
The Director is programmed to ensure the survival of humanity by any means necessary. This primarily involves sending humans backwards through time to correct the mistakes made by their ancestors "at peril of [their] own birth." This is known as the Traveler program. Travelers are responsible for enacting the Grand Plan, a list of changes to the past that are intended to mitigate humankind's near-extinction.

The first mission ordered by the Director was proof of concept. Traveler 001 was sent into a host who worked in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, minutes before the attack. He was ordered to send a message indicating he had arrived safely, then die to prevent being traced. When the Traveler in question failed to send the message and escaped the building unscathed, the Director dedicated vast resources and personnel to tracking him - even killing two people via messenger just to order 001 to "self-terminate."

The Traveler program may have been put on hold in the future after the defection of 001. Simon - himself Traveler 004 - claims to have spent years searching for Vincent Ingram's voice. Simon's own mission from the Director was to set up the deep web communication network used by the Travelers.

According to the original historical record, Earth is struck by asteroid Helios-685 in 2018, an event that kills over 93 million people. One iteration of the Grand Plan centered around deflecting this asteroid. This proved insufficient; the future did not change substantially after the Travelers prevented the impact.

The entirety of the Grand Plan is not know to any Traveler; teams are separated and assigned their own missions, and Protocol 6 forbids inter-team communication except in emergencies.

The Coup
Events that occurred during the year 2016 changed the future in unforeseen ways. A bunker which originally collapsed became the birthplace of the Faction in this alternate timeline. The Faction eventually gained enough power to pose a threat to the Director. In response, it ordered Ellis to travel to the 21st and build a quantum frame, a device capable of storing the Director. This way if the Director's existence were ever in danger, it could send itself back in time. However, it later ordered the destruction of the same device, since it could also be used by the Faction to store human consciousnesses.

After Grace reset the Director to prevent it from being corrupted, the Faction was able to seize control and shut it down. The Traveler program continued to run, with the Faction impersonating the Director and ordering Travelers on missions they agreed with. Trevor Holden was able to place a device in the Director's future location which powered the Director for three seconds - enough time for it to regain control of the Traveler program. Afterwards, the Director ordered its disciples to hunt down and execute Faction members still alive in the past.

Following a mass capture of Faction agents, the Director ordered the arrest and trial of Grace Day for interfering with the Grand Plan. The Director had determined that one of the three remaining programmers was a Faction turncoat, so it sent all three suspects back in time to review the historical record. Grace was never actually suspected of being the Faction traitor, and her "trial" was only ever a cover. It revealed the ploy to Grace during her sentencing, speaking to her in real time by use of elderly people on life support as messengers. The Director seemed to be genuinely fond of Grace (although it was left ambiguous as to whether the Director fond of her as a parent, child, or peer); it ended the conversation by saying "Thank you for saving me, Grace. I shall miss you."

Discovery
"Discovery was inevitable at this juncture of the Grand Plan. Cooperation with 21st century authorities is now the optimal path."
— The Director[src]
In 2018 a coordinated effort by world intelligence agencies located conclusive proof of the existence of the Traveler program. Rather than continue to cover its tracks, the Director chose to reveal its existence the world governments by speaking through Ilsa, an advanced artificial intelligence developed in the 21st.

When a Traveler team was deemed non-viable, the Director created a powerful messenger program to complete a mission preventing a nuclear plant from melting down. The Messenger failed to shut off and remained in its host. The Director eventually spoke to the Messenger (who had possessed the body of Trevor Holden) and offered it a domain within itself. The Messenger was then reabsorbed into the Director.

Later the Director summoned Trevor again, who was now suffering from temporal aphasia. The two spoke privately, wherein they agreed to use Trevor's body as a host for a new Traveler. The plan did not move forward, however.

Failure
The first iteration of the Traveler program failed when the Faction launched nuclear attacks on the Director's archives. While the attacks did not blind the Director as intended, they set in motion a chain of events that - coupled with further interference from Traveler 001 - led to nuclear warfare long before it was "fated" to happen. Using a program that the Director uploaded to Ilsa, Grant MacLaren traveled back in time to prevent the arrival of 001. This resulted in the termination of Version One and the inception of Version Two.
